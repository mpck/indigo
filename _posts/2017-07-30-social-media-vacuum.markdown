Before 2007, most people went about their day without the worry of becoming disconnected from the internet. While some may have had a cell phone in their pocket, there was nothing on is that made them dependent on their device mainly because phones use to serve their greatest purpose very well: being a portable telephone. 

This suddenly changed when Steve Job’s walked onto the stage in 2007 and introduced the world to Apple’s new product, which was an internet browser, iPod, and a telephone all-in-one. It was beyond anything that anybody had on the market at the time and it ultimately shaped future technological advances and not always for the better. For some people, this simple device called the ‘iPhone’ was just an added bonus to have. Now they were able to do everything they needed to during a normal business day but they no longer had to be behind a desk and talk on a phone that was attached to the outlet or boot up their ancient computer so they could reply to an email. For a lot of people, using the internet had become instantly easier overnight. This is something that we were not use to and we were not prepared for it.
